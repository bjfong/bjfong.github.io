                    <p class="text-faded">The idea of this trip started off with my boss Joel and me. We were casually talking about going to a trip somewhere so we could use the rest of our PTO that wouldn't roll over to the next year. He hadn't been to Tokyo before and I was just a new grad who wanted to get his feet wet into traveling.<br><br>
                    I was in a training session at work when he and I were talking about it. When the idea of Japan came up, I happened to be sitting next to two people who we both knew (he knew them better than me), Kyle and Emi. This is how I brought it up to them: I turned to them, said "Hey, Tokyo?" and they said, "Yeah I'm down." Pretty neat right?<br><br>
                    After getting a small group of people who were interested, they also convinced another person to come with us, Guillermo. We settled on a date (December 3 - December 10), bought our tickets, found a nice Airbnb in the Shinjuku area, and started planning what we were going to do for a week there.<br><br>
                    Now, I love to plan trips. Just the thought of researching a country or a city and really getting a dive (albeit shallow) into a culture and what it has to offer me is amazing. Because of my personality, I created a Google doc that contained restaurants, attractions, and other things we wanted to do. <u><a style="color:black;" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C78CPg2ik5Gzc7CPPZYm3AHmJRgQhp_TmMb4VybPMko" target="_blank">Here</a></u> is the link if you want to check it out. It wasn't necessarily a "follow the itinerary as closely as possible" type of doc (as none of these that I create are), but they're more of a "here are a bunch of ideas, let's decide what we all want to do and if you have any ideas put them on here" type of doc.<br><br>
                    So after we figured out for the most part what we wanted to do, it was just a matter of preparing for our trip, buying day tour passes, and then we were off!</p>

                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">I hadn't been on an international flight since high school, so I forgot a lot about the extra couple things I had to do while at the airport. I also remembered how nice international flights were; they gave free headphones (albeit not the best), toothbrush and socks, pillow and blanket. I was excited for the airplane food, but my favorite part of the flight was unlimited free alcoholic beverages! Joel told us about them and I had no idea that was a thing! I only got two drinks because drinking on the flight gave me a headache, but that is something I'll remember for my next international flight ;) all I did on the flight was watching the show Peaky Blinders. I downloaded them offline on Netflix and just binged the crap out of it. I watched 8 hours worth of episodes during the 12 hour flight, that's how enticing it was!<br><br>

                    When we got to the Narita airport, we were already overwhelmed by all the Japanese people were speaking to us. We didn't understand any of it, and all the signs were in Japanese as well. We had some trouble figuring out where we needed to get the train tickets and the 3-day subway pass, but eventually we got out of the airport and onto the train to Tokyo. After a 50 minute train ride, we arrived at Tokyo Station and then had to transfer to another subway to go to the Yotsuya Station. When we arrived, we were lost on how to get to the Airbnb, but eventually we made our way there. Our Airbnb host, Ben, helped us out with directions to get there and even met us near his place! He was very welcoming and nice.<br><br>

                    Most of the rest of the trip can be explained in the pictures below, but it was just a ton of sightseeing and taking pictures of food. We all went full-on tourist taking pictures of even the minute things. But hey, when in Tokyo right? We drank a lot of beer, ate a lot of yakitori, ramen, and sushi, and I couldn't be happier. Sushi is my favorite food, so eating authentic, fresh, salmon was a dream come true for me. And I always love a good bowl on ramen on a cold December day in Japan. The only thing is because we didn't know any Japanese, we had to either use the Google Translate picture translator or just point at things that we wanted. Some of the people such as restaurant and airport employees knew basic English to help us, but if it wasn't for Google, we would all be screwed.</p>

                            <li><p>We went to two Michelin-starred restaurants: <a href="http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/04/13/nakajima/" target="_blank">Shinjuku Nakajima</a> and <a href="http://www.thewholeworldisaplayground.com/how-to-eat-tsuta-tokyo-michelin-star-ramen/" target="_blank">Tsuta</a>. Both were delicious!</p></li>
                            <li><p>We all got stares from locals, but Emi and Guillermo got the bulk of them. I guess they don't see Hispanic people too often.</p></li>
                            <li><p>I don't always take selfies, but when I do, it's when I'm in Tokyo.</p></li>
                            <li><p>One day, we were taking pictures and I overheard this family taking pictures and were speaking Cantonese. I don't know what came over me but I went up to them and asked in Cantonese if they wanted me to take a picture for them. They said yes and for SOME REASON, I couldn't take a picture with their fancy camera. I kept pressing the button and it just didn't work. It was a little embarrassing LOL but I just ended up using their phone to take a picture. Sucks because one of the daughters was cute. Oh well!</p></li>
                            <li><p>I pretty much wore the same Uniqlo jacket every day during the trip. It was the best jacket to block the wind and the cold, and it was light as well. It was my dad's but I need to get one of my own.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The owner of that gyro truck was an American who had been living in Japan for 10+ years. He grew up in Japan because his dad was in the military, but he grew up in Florida and still kept up with the Japanese culture. His friends in Japan would send him comics and toys. I just think that's so cool.</p></li>
                            <li><p>We met this man and his wife when we went to Yakitori Alley because we could tell that he spoke some English. We talked to him about what he did and he said he manufactured paper. He bought us a bottle of beer and offered to buy us more but we wanted to get to the next place, but he was very nice! He said he wants to move to the U.S. and we said we wanted to move to Japan. Too bad we can't trade places!</p></li>
                            <li><p>On Friday night of the trip (our last night), we went to a couple bars. We saw this waitress who was gorgeous, and Kyle and I were trying to figure out what ethnicity she was. She spoke fluent Japanese but she was not Japanese. We wondered for the longest time and we finally got the courage to ask her. She said she was from Nepal.</p></li>
                            <li><p>That same night, when we got back to the Airbnb, I took off my contacts and passed out. The next morning, the others told me that I was sleepwalking, trying to find my glasses and phone and was looking in my imaginary pockets and was pulling imaginary drawers. I don't remember any of that.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Kyle met up with a Japanese girl on the day we left. He went to lunch with her and said that she was coming to LA on Christmas and they will probably see each other again ;)</p></li>
                            <li><p>After we got back, we went to a happy hour, and my boss' boss saw us talking to each other and he said, "You guys aren't tired of each other?!" To which Emi replied, "We like each other even more now!" He had a hilarious look of (playful) disgust on his face.</p></li>
                            <li><p>We saw a couple of Soapland places hahaha Joel thought about going in but he ended up not going in.</p></li>
                            <li><p><u>Souvenirs</u>: Suntory Whiskey and a shot glass for myself; Green tea kit kat and a sword keychain for Brian Chin; a magnet for Adrienne; Green tea kit kat and melon kit kat for Jessica and Eliott; Green tea kit kat and Tokyo Tower keychain for Brian Mendoza; Two mugs for my parents. Also a bag of Robot Restaurant chips that one of the performers threw to me in the crowd. A picture of some souvenirs can be found <a href="../img/tokyo/souvenir.jpg">here</a>.</p></li>
                            <li><p>I told myself I wasn't going to eat any Japanese food for a while. The first lunch on my first day back to work: a Japanese buffet. The sushi was so sub-par, I actually spit a piece out. Sushi is my favorite food, but I guess I spoiled my food pallet. Once you eat sushi in Japan, you can't go back.</p></li>

                    <p>
                        <ul class="text-faded">
                            <li><p>How clean and safe Tokyo is. No trash and very few homeless people.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How most of the streets are very small.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How convenient the subway system is! You can walk underground a couple blocks from where you get off the subway and don't run into any stop lights or cars.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The trains are punctual and frequent. Missing a train is never an issue because there's another one coming in four minutes.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Many restaurants only have one or two employees. Seems like they're just mom and pop shops which is always great to see.</p></li>
                            <li><p>At the sushi boat restaurant we went to, we order through an iPad. You can only order three things at a time, and they make it and send the "boat" directly to your table. Sushi doesn't go round and round like they typically do. The only thing is we had a time limit of 45 minutes which we thought wasn't enough time, but it was just enough for us.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How everyone follows the rules. They all walk on the designated sides on the streets and on the stairs. It doesn't mean it doesn't still get crowded and crazy in the train stations though.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Unlimited free alcoholic drinks on the plane! Gotta say it again.</p></li>
                            <li><p>You order your food from vending machines! Saves a lot of time and takes away a lot of the messiness that comes with money after you eat. You pick what you want, you pay, you give the worker your ticket, you eat, and then you leave.</p></li>
                            <li><p>There's no tax and people don't tip. Even less messiness.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The tax-free concept. Some stores are tax-free if you spend a certain amount of money and some stores are tax-free for foreigners if you show a passport.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How cheap the food is there. Authentic ramen for $8?! Yes please.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How the only Japanese words I knew were hello, thank you, and beer. I just bowed most of the time.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Small portions. I guess I'm not used to it, but this is a positive because I was never too full so I could try more things.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Our Mt. Fuji tour. Maybe I expected more or the sun was in the way but the view that we got wasn't good. We got close but the pictures we took didn't catch how nice it looked. The one further away looked better. Our tour guide was great though.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Drinks are very watered down. Even some whiskey drinks had water in it. Also, the beers have low alcohol % that just means I just have to pee more in order to get drunk.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How I took a lot of pictures in portrait mode :( my OCD/perfectionist side of me kicks in about how not neat the pictures are, but hey, I know for next time.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How they're very strict about where they put their trash and their recyclables. This is because I'm personally not used to it so I was a little confused, but it's good for the environment.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Tinder isn't fun. I only got one match, but from Kyle's experiences, it seems like they're nicer and more likely to talk to you than girls in the U.S.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Little to no trash cans. I understand <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Tokyo-have-so-few-public-trash-cans" target="_blank">why</a> they do that, but it's still frustrating when I'm holding my trash for half an hour and still can't find a trash can.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How you use one bill and you get a ton of coins in return. I'm not the best with coins and didn't have anywhere safe to put them, so they kept dropping from my pocket.</p></li>

                        <ul class="text-faded">
                            <li><p>If you know someone who speaks Japanese, it helps a lot when talking to those who may not know any English. You don't need to point and if that person is a local, you get the best recommendations.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Bring a booklet or download an app on your phone that allows you to translate common English phrases for tourists into Japanese. I personally didn't use one but I downloaded one and it seemed like it would be helpful to use to get around.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Get the 72-hour pass for the JR lines at the airport. We bought them for ¥1500, so worth! We used ¥1500 worth on the first day alone. You can also buy a 24-hour one at the subway station kiosks for ¥1000. Can't beat that, since a one-way ticket is ¥170.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Three days or so is enough in Tokyo. If you're going for a week like I did, go to Kyoto for a couple days. it's a lot more traditional and the night life is not as big, but it's different. Because it's more traditional and old-school, fewer people might know English so that's why having someone who knows Japanese will be helpful.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Either get a sim card at the airport which is like $35 for 1.5GB of data, or get a hotspot which is $55 for unlimited data. I got the AT&T international plan which was $40 for 200MB which was not worth it at all compared to the others. The only thing is I had unlimited text and the other two options don't, but why need to text when there are so many other messaging apps nowadays? I piggybacked off Emi's hotspot so I didn't go over, and that's what I will get next time. Your group can all pitch in for a hotspot, but be aware that it won't go too far and you will most likely split up, so I would still say get your own form of data so you can communicate with other people when you split from the group.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Go to the Robot Restaurant if you're in the area! It was one of the best parts about the trip, it was just an awesome production and very well put together. Great experience!</p></li>
                            <li><p>Bring cash! A lot of the mom and pop stores only accept cash and your cards most likely have a foreign transaction fee. Just hope that when you exchange it back to USD that you get a decent rate.</p></li>

                    <p class="text-faded">This was a great first trip to dip my feet in. I loved everything about my experience in Japan, and I would definitely go again. I would want to go to a country that I haven't been to first before going back to Japan, but if I went again, I would live in another area but definitely do most of the things I did last time. But of course, the company matters so much and I'm glad I went with people I got along with and I didn't ruin relations with them, especially my boss :) I can't wait to continue going on more trips. We already decided on going to Cuba next, so we'll see where that takes us. Most of all, I miss the food in Japan so much and would go only for the cheap food and drinks.
