# Brian's Adventures

This repository contains my adventures. I go on different trips locally or internationally, and I document them by adding them to my website. I write about certain periods of times in my life that I really enjoyed and show it to you.

To view the adventures website, go to: https://bjfong.github.io/adventures

On the website, you'll read more about myself, my background, and my trips. I hope you enjoy!
