The place is called <a style="color:black;" href="https://magiqescaperoom.com/los-angeles" target="_blank">MagIQ Escape Room</a> in LA. He thought it would be a good team building exercise and invited some coworkers to try it. He had done escape rooms before, trying three and completing one. I, on the other hand, had never done one before but I've always wanted to try. He settled on a date (December 20, 2016) and time (7pm) and difficuly (intermediate) and we were off! </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Trip</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">I'll explain the details in a high-level manner, just in case anyone decides to try out this room. I wouldn't want to give it away! So if you're reading this and want to try the room someday, look away! <br><br>

                    (Okay I warned you) There were seven people who went: Joel, Chip, Isidro, Jorge, Kyle, Guillermo, and myself. The room was pirate-themed and the objective was to 1) get out of a jail cell and 2) find the treasure which will lead us out of the room. We had an hour to exit the room. The only things they give you are a light, a pen and a paper to write things.<br><br>

                    In the first part, we were in a small jail cell. There was a mirror, a picture of a cannon and some arrows, and three compasses. We were stuck for about 15-20 minutes, but eventually Isidro used the mirror to see words on top of the cell that were out of our view. We saw three directions that we put into the three compasses and the box opened, containing a bunch of sticks. We attached the sticks together to form a long stick and used it to pluck the key from outside the cell. We got the key and unlocked the cell.<br><br>

                    In the second part, we were in a bigger room with a couple barrels, a desk, a tree with more arrows, a boat with more arrows, a circular maze that can be spinned by a wheel, and a cog that mapped one letter to one number. Chip was able to get the 4-digit combination to open the lock behind the circular maze. We unlocked the lock and found twelve letters. We saw a couple of these letters all around the room and on other objects (some inside the desk, one on the paddle, some inside eggs in the circular maze, etc...). We figured out what letters we had found, and the ones that were left were L, A, M, and P. We used the cog to map each letter to a number, and Kyle used those numbers from LAMP to unlock the door to another room (I swear I tried that combination and it didn't work, I guess I suck at locks). We were stuck in this room for a while too, it took maybe 15-20 minutes as well.<br><br>

                    In the third part, we were on a beach setting, and there was so much going on, but we were getting the hang of it. Behind the door, there was a linear equations type picture with fruits. We calculated what each fruit's number was and tried it in a 3-digit lock but it didn't work. Kyle and Guillermo worked on getting a key out of a maze via magnet. I looked back at the equations and saw that bananas was 40 but in the last equation, there were only three bananas and not four. Four bananas was 40 so three bananas was 30. The total was 140 instead of 150. I tried it on the lock but it didn't work. Then Joel opened a lock in the previous room that was inside the desk using 140. Inside were pieces of a puzzle that we put together. On the completed puzzle was a treasure map, but after a while, Joel saw the giant numbers on top of the puzzle: "1640". We used that to open another lock, opening a pattern of sorts and skeleton bones. This was what the pictures and arrows were used for. We followed the arrows for each pictures, resulting in a number. We used these numbers to open the second of two locks and went into another room.<br><br>

                    In this final part, we saw a skeleton, a knob in a puzzle against the wall, and a glass case. Kyle saw the key in the back left corner and used some wire to get it out. Guillermo got the knob out of the wall, and we used both to open a treasure case that had a bunch of keys. Joel realized that none of the keys worked on the door (they were too big) but a little later, he saw that there was another normal key attached as well. He used that key to open the door, and it opened! We were out!</p>
