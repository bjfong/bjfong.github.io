                    <p class="text-faded">The idea of this trip started off with my boss Joel and me. We were casually talking about going to a trip somewhere so we could use the rest of our PTO that wouldn't roll over to the next year. He hadn't been to Tokyo before and I was just a new grad who wanted to get his feet wet into traveling.<br><br>

                    I was in a training session at work when he and I were talking about it. When the idea of Japan came up, I happened to be sitting next to two people who we both knew (he knew them better than me), Kyle and Emi. This is how I brought it up to them: I turned to them, said "Hey, Tokyo?" and they said, "Yeah I'm down." Pretty neat right?<br><br>

                    After getting a small group of people who were interested, they also convinced another person to come with us, Guillermo. We settled on a date (December 3 - December 10), bought our tickets, found a nice Airbnb in the Shinjuku area, and started planning what we were going to do for a week there.<br><br>

                    Now, I love to plan trips. Just the thought of researching a country or a city and really getting a dive (albeit shallow) into a culture and what it has to offer me is amazing. Because of my personality, I created a Google doc that contained restaurants, attractions, and other things we wanted to do. <u><a style="color:black;" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C78CPg2ik5Gzc7CPPZYm3AHmJRgQhp_TmMb4VybPMko" target="_blank">Here</a></u> is the link if you want to check it out. It wasn't necessarily a "follow the itinerary as closely as possible" type of doc (as none of these that I create are), but they're more of a "here are a bunch of ideas, let's decide what we all want to do and if you have any ideas put them on here" type of doc.<br><br>

                    So after we figured out for the most part what we wanted to do, it was just a matter of preparing for our trip, buying day tour passes, and then we were off!</p>

                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">I hadn't been on an international flight since high school, so I forgot a lot about the extra couple things I had to do while at the airport. I also remembered how nice international flights were; they gave free headphones (albeit not the best), toothbrush and socks, pillow and blanket. I was excited for the airplane food, but my favorite part of the flight was unlimited free alcoholic beverages! Joel told us about them and I had no idea that was a thing! I only got two drinks because drinking on the flight gave me a headache, but that is something I'll remember for my next international flight ;) all I did on the flight was watching the show Peaky Blinders. I downloaded them offline on Netflix and just binged the crap out of it. I watched 8 hours worth of episodes during the 12 hour flight, that's how enticing it was!<br><br>

                    When we got to the Narita airport, we were already overwhelmed by all the Japanese people were speaking to us. We didn't understand any of it, and all the signs were in Japanese as well. We had some trouble figuring out where we needed to get the train tickets and the 3-day subway pass, but eventually we got out of the airport and onto the train to Tokyo. After a 50 minute train ride, we arrived at Tokyo Station and then had to transfer to another subway to go to the Yotsuya Station. When we arrived, we were lost on how to get to the Airbnb, but eventually we made our way there. Our Airbnb host, Ben, helped us out with directions to get there and even met us near his place! He was very welcoming and nice.<br><br>

                    Most of the rest of the trip can be explained in the pictures below, but it was just a ton of sightseeing and taking pictures of food. We all went full-on tourist taking pictures of even the minute things. But hey, when in Tokyo right? We drank a lot of beer, ate a lot of yakitori, ramen, and sushi, and I couldn't be happier. Sushi is my favorite food, so eating authentic, fresh, salmon was a dream come true for me. And I always love a good bowl on ramen on a cold December day in Japan. The only thing is because we didn't know any Japanese, we had to either use the Google Translate picture translator or just point at things that we wanted. Some of the people such as restaurant and airport employees knew basic English to help us, but if it wasn't for Google, we would all be screwed.</p>

                            <li><p>We went to two Michelin-starred restaurants: <a href="http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/04/13/nakajima/" target="_blank">Shinjuku Nakajima</a> and <a href="http://www.thewholeworldisaplayground.com/how-to-eat-tsuta-tokyo-michelin-star-ramen/" target="_blank">Tsuta</a>. Both were delicious!</p></li>
                            <li><p>We all got stares from locals, but Emi and Guillermo got the bulk of them. I guess they don't see Hispanic people too often.</p></li>

                            <li><p>We met this man and his wife when we went to Yakitori Alley because we could tell that he spoke some English. We talked to him about what he did and he said he manufactured paper. He bought us a bottle of beer and offered to buy us more but we wanted to get to the next place, but he was very nice! He said he wants to move to the U.S. and we said we wanted to move to Japan. Too bad we can't trade places!</p></li>
                            <li><p>On Friday night of the trip (our last night), we went to a couple bars. We saw this waitress who was gorgeous, and Kyle and I were trying to figure out what ethnicity she was. She spoke fluent Japanese but she was not Japanese. We wondered for the longest time and we finally got the courage to ask her. She said she was from Nepal.</p></li>
                            <li><p>That same night, when we got back to the Airbnb, I took off my contacts and passed out. The next morning, the others told me that I was sleepwalking, trying to find my glasses and phone and was looking in my imaginary pockets and was pulling imaginary drawers. I don't remember any of that.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Kyle met up with a Japanese girl on the day we left. He went to lunch with her and said that she was coming to LA on Christmas and they will probably see each other again ;)</p></li>
                            <li><p>After we got back, we went to a happy hour, and my boss' boss saw us talking to each other and he said, "You guys aren't tired of each other?!" To which Emi replied, "We like each other even more now!" He had a hilarious look of (playful) disgust on his face.</p></li>

                            <li><p>How convenient the subway system is! You can walk underground a couple blocks from where you get off the subway and don't run into any stop lights or cars.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The trains are punctual and frequent. Missing a train is never an issue because there's another one coming in four minutes.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Many restaurants only have one or two employees. Seems like they're just mom and pop shops which is always great to see.</p></li>
                            <li><p>How everyone follows the rules. They all walk on the designated sides on the streets and on the stairs. It doesn't mean it doesn't still get crowded and crazy in the train stations though.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Unlimited free alcoholic drinks on the plane! Gotta say it again.</p></li>
                            <li><p>You order your food from vending machines! Saves a lot of time and takes away a lot of the messiness that comes with money after you eat. You pick what you want, you pay, you give the worker your ticket, you eat, and then you leave.</p></li>
                            <li><p>There's no tax and people don't tip. Even less messiness.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Drinks are very watered down. Even some whiskey on-the-rocks had some water in it. Also, the beers are like 4.5% alcohol, that's no fun and I just have to pee more to get drunk.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Tinder isn't fun. I only got one match, but from Kyle's experiences, it seems like they're nicer and more likely to talk to you than girls in the U.S.</p></li>

                            <li><p>If you know someone who speaks Japanese, it helps a lot when talking to those who may not know any English. You don't need to point and if that person is a local, you get the best recommendations.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Three days or so is enough in Tokyo. If you're going for a week like I did, go to Kyoto for a couple days. it's a lot more traditional and the night life is not as big, but it's different. Because it's more traditional and old-school, fewer people might know English so that's why having someone who knows Japanese will be helpful.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Either get a sim card at the airport which is like $35 for 1.5GB of data, or get a hotspot which is $55 for unlimited data. I got the AT&T international plan which was $40 for 200MB which was not worth it at all compared to the others. The only thing is I had unlimited text and the other two options don't, but why need to text when there are so many other messaging apps nowadays? I piggybacked off Emi's hotspot so I didn't go over, and that's what I will get next time. Your group can all pitch in for a hotspot, but be aware that it won't go too far and you will most likely split up, so I would still say get your own form of data so you can communicate with other people when you split from the group.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Bring cash! A lot of the mom and pop stores only accept cash and your cards most likely have a foreign transaction fee. Just hope that when you exchange it back to USD that you get a decent rate.</p></li>

                    <p class="text-faded">This was a great trip to dip my feet in. I loved everything about my experience in Japan, and I would definitely go again. I would want to go to a country that I haven't been to first before going back to Japan, but if I went again, I would live in another area but definitely do most of the things I did last time. I miss the food so much and would go for the cheap food and drinks. I smile when I see pictures and I have many good memories. <i class="fa fa-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
